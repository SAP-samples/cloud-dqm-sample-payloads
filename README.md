   * samplesAdminTasks
   * samplesReverseGeo 
   
   To see a sample request, select Collections in the navigation panel, and select a collection name to expand it. The samplesAddressCleanse collection has multiple folders, therefore select a folder name to expand it. Select one of the sample request names to see the body of the request.

Update Environment Variables
--------------------------------------
You must update both variables in the samplesEnvironment environment.

1. On the SAP Business Technology Platform, navigate into your subaccount and access the Credentials window that includes the contents of the service key. If you are not familiar with how to do this, see the instructions or the video on the Accessing DQM Microservices page of the SAP Help Portal.
2. The value for the applicationURL variable is the value for the "uri" property in the Credentials window, but you must include the prefix "https://" and the suffix "/dq". Enter that value in Postman as the current value.

3. To get the value for the oauthAccessToken variable you will get values from the Credentials window to enter in one of the sample requests, and send the request. Begin by selecting Collections in the navigation panel, expanding the samplesAdminTasks collection, and selecting the "Request oAuth token" sample request.

4. In the URL replace {ReplaceWithTokenEndpoint} with the value for the "url" property in the Credentials window, but you must include the suffix "/oauth/token". Enter that value in Postman in the URL in place of {ReplaceWithTokenEndpoint}, being careful to keep the "?". (The host for your token endpoint will be slightly different than the host shown in the following screen shot.)

5. Go to the Authorization tab. In the Username replace {ReplaceWithClientID} with the value for the "clientid" property in the Credentials window, and in the Password replace the masked characters with the value for the "clientsecret" property in the Credentials window.

6. Make sure samplesEnvironment is selected in the active environment combo box.

7. Send the request by selecting the Send button.

8. The value for the oauthAccessToken appears in the response in the lower pane of Postman in the access_token property. You do not have to copy the value because the sample request includes a script in the Tests tab that automatically transfers the access_token value to the active environment. Select Environments in the navigation panel, and select the samplesEnvironment name to confirm that the value is transferred successfully.

9. Save the sample request "Request oAuth token". The access token expires after 12 hours and you will have to resend this sample request each day of your testing period to generate a new one.
